# Introduction

The mod is a library/dependency for other mods, offering a common interface and screenspace for other mods to offer simple buttons.

This mod doesn't actually do anything interesting on its own.

It simply adds a tab at the bottom that many other mods can use to consolidate buttons.

A bunch of my other mods use this:
